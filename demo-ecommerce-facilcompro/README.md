In this folder, I want to share with you some screenshots of my personal project named FacilCompro.<br/>
It is an ecommerce application I developed between the years 2016 ~ 2017 completly alone from zero.<br/>
I used the following technologies in the development <br/>
. Ruby on Rails 4.0 <br/>
. Devise, CanCan for authorization, authentication and roles. <br/>
. Postgresql as database <br/>
. Bootstrap, HTML5, SaaS <br/>
. Sentry.io as log service <br/>
. Prawn PDF for report generator <br/>
The main features of the app are: <br/>
. Home page with an input search <br/>
. Shopping cart page <br/>
. Checkout page <br/>
. Products by categories page <br/>
. Admin page to register productos, categories, promotions and more. <br/>
